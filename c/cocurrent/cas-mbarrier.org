On x86, it will turn into a lock prefixed assembly instruction, like LOCK XADD.
Being a single instruction, it is non-interruptible. As an added "feauture",
 the lock prefix results in a full memory barrier:
A memory barrier is in fact implemented as a dummy LOCK OR or LOCK AND in both the .NET and the JAVA JIT on x86/x64.
So you have a full fence on x86 as an added bonus, whether you like it or not. :)
